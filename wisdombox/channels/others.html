	<h3>Live in the now</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Past is past and future does not exist.</li>
		<li>There is no past, but memories.</li>
		<li>Past and future are no real. You can only think about them.</li>
		<li>Don't look back, don't look forward. Just look and breathe and listen, touch, smell, taste, feel and smile. Live in the now.</li>

	<h3>The Power of the present moment</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>All unhappiness is formed when we take our being away from the present moment</li>
		<li>Most of us seem to be always searching for some place else, some better moment in the future. But that moment never comes. Because when that moment comes we want more.</li>
		<li>When we can truly grasp this powerful present moment, there are no problems, there are only miracles</li>
		<li>The success all of us seek is really just the feeling we believe we will get in achieving it. So the success itself is really a feeling.</li>
		<li>When we stop seeking an end point and instead make each moment an end in itself. When we can appreciate the journey, so much that a destination is not needed, the journey is the new destination. That is what life is really all about...making the most out of each moment!</li>
