	<h3>If you've ever struggled to control your emotions, you must watch this</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Reaction is from one perspective. It is not the only perspective.</li>
		<li>If you shift the way you are viewing what happened to you, you could have a totally different reaction.</li>
		<li>Failure becomes something to be feared because people feel negative, feels like a loss, death.</li>
		<li>"What is defeat? Nothing but education. Nothing but the first steps to something better."</li>
		<li>"It was always me versus the world, until I found, it's me verus me."</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>If you feel lost, you must watch this</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>"Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of others, instead, seek what they sought."</li>
		<li>This is not about imitating somebody, this is about figuring out what you want.</li>
		<li>If it is a moment of beauty for you and you understand how to build it...build it.</li>
		<li>Everything around you is incredible if you are willing to look at it that way. Everything around you can be taken for granted if that is your perspective.</li>
		<li>"People say what we are all seeking is a meaning for life, but I don't think that's what we're really seeking, I think what we're seeking is the experience of truly being alive."</li>
		<li>The name of the game isn't wealth, it isn't fame, it isn't ambition or success. It is neurochemistry. It is feeling a certain way. It is finding fullfillment in your life.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>If you're thinking about giving up, I made this for you</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>"A hero is one who knows how to hang on for one minute longer."</li>
		<li>"It is not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it."</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>Stop Right Now: What is your Goal?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Once you know what it looks like to win, then you can work backwards</li>
		<li>"The trouble with not having a goal is that you can spend your life running up and down the field and never score."</li>
		<li>"If you want to conquer fear don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy."</li>
		<li>"I live to be the ruler of life not a slave to meet life as a powerful conqueror and nothing exterior to me will ever take command of me."</li>
		<li>"Work for someting because it is good, not just because it stands the chance to succeed."</li>
		<li>"Welcome those big sticky complicated problems. In them are your most powerful opportunities."</li>
		<li>"Many are stubborn in pursuit of the path they have chosen. Few in pursuit of the goal."</li>
		<li>"Don't confuse the finger with the moon it's pointing at."</li>
		<li>"If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people, not to things."</li>
		<li>People and things can change, you have no control over them. The end of the day, the only thing you control is yourself.</li>
		<li>"Everybody is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it's stupid."</li>
		<li>"When 99% of people doubt your idea you're either gravely wrong or about to make a history."</li>
		<li>"The future belongs to those who prepare for it today."</li>
		<li>"If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl. But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward."</li>
